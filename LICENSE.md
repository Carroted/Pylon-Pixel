# THE CARROTED LICENSE
Version 1.2 by Carroted

## DEFINITIONS
We, we, Us, us, US, Carroted, CARROTED and WE refer to Carroted, throughout this entire file or document, including the "Why" section.

You, you and YOU refer to you or a group that you represent.

## LICENSE
You, or a group that you represent, may make changes to this code and submit them (in the form of pull requests), or use them for your own builds. You may build/compile this game for personal reasons, but **do not distribute these builds**. Only us, Carroted, may distribute builds of this game. Carroted has the right to distribute paid builds of this game for commercial use. Only Carroted can distribute builds, paid or unpaid.
To make that more clear, just don't distribute builds of Pylon Pixel (renaming it doesn't change anything).
    
We may modify this license at any time.

## Why?
We want to make the game's source open so people can learn from it, modify it, and more. However, for this to be our jobs, we need to be able to make money from the game. For this reason, we will sell prebuilt versions of the game. Anyone can build the game themselves, but they can't share that build. We hope this makes sense! The alternative would've been closed source, like most other games.
