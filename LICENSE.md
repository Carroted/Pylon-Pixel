# THE CARROTED LICENSE
Version 1.1 by Carroted

## DEFINITIONS
We, we, Us, us, US, Carroted, CARROTED and WE refer to Carroted, throughout this entire file or document, including the "Why" section.

You, you and YOU refer to you or a group that you represent.

## LICENSE
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THIS PROJECT AND SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. CARROTED DOES NOT WARRANT AND NOTHING IN THIS LICENSE IMPLIES ANY WARRANTY THAT THE OPERATION OF SOFTWARE AND/OR HARDWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE, OR THAT ANY ERRORS FOUND WILL BE CORRECTED.

If you do not agree to this license, you may not interact with the project. You may not download the project and/or clone the project.
If anyone else, or anything else does not agree to the license, they may also not interact with the project.

By agreeing to the license, you agree to the following points, and are legally bound to follow them:

 1. You, or a group that you represent, may make changes to this code
    and submit them (in the form of pull requests), or use them for your
    own builds. You may build/compile this game for personal reasons,
    but **do not distribute these builds**. Only us, Carroted, may
    distribute builds of this game. Carroted has the right to distribute
    paid builds of this game for commercial use. Only Carroted can
    distribute builds, paid or unpaid.
    
2. You may learn from the source of the game, but **do not outright
    copy our scripts and call it a different game**. To make that more
    precise, just don't use more than 50% of the scripts we (Carroted)
    made for this game in a single project other than personal versions
    of the game or a download of the project to modify scripts and
    test/build.
    
3. We may modify this license at any time. If we do, previous versions
    of the game are unaffected by the license change, only future ones.

## Why?
We want to make the game's source open so people can learn from it, modify it, and more. However, for this to be our jobs, we need to be able to make money from the game. For this reason, we will sell prebuilt versions of the game. Anyone can build the game themselves, but they can't share that build. We hope this makes sense! The alternative would've been closed source, like most other games.
